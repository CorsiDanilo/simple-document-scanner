## 🏛️ Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure a decoupled and testable codebase:

```mermaid
graph TD
    UI[Presentation / UI] --> VM[ViewModels]
    VM --> UC[Domain / UseCases]
    UC --> REPO[Data / Repositories]
    REPO --> ML[ML Kit / Local Storage]
```

- **Presentation**: UI components (Compose) and ViewModels.
- **Domain**: Business logic, UseCases, and Repository interfaces.
- **Data**: Implementation of repositories, local data sources, and ML Kit integrations.
