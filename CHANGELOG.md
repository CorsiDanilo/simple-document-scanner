# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **In-App Auto Updater**: L'app si collega a GitHub all'avvio per verificare la presenza di nuove release. Se presenti, un popup informativo permette l'aggiornamento rapido in background.
- **Pulizia Archiviazione Intelligente**: Durante l'avvio, l'applicazione svuota la cache di sistema rimuovendo gli script d'installazione scaricati e pacchetti APK obsoleti.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Save Reliability (PDF/Image)**:
  - Fixed `ENOENT (No such file or directory)` errors when saving scans in some environments.
  - The app now ensures target storage directories are created before writing PDF or image files.
  - Added clearer failure handling when the storage path is invalid or cannot be created.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Swipe Gestures on Scans**: 
  - Left-to-Right swipe (Blue) to rename scans instantly.
  - Right-to-Left swipe (Red) to delete scans directly from the list.
- **Onboarding UI Hint**: First-time users will now see an automated slide-in and out visual hint of the swipe actions on their first scan.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Preview Screen Optimization**: Preview background was enhanced to appear cleaner and layout was fixed to prevent the image from overlapping with the document name.
- **Auto-save on Share**: Shared scans from the Preview Screen are now seamlessly saved in "My Scans" automatically. Added an informative text on the share dialog explaining this.
- **Cleaner Scan List**: Removed static edit/delete action icons from the individual scan rows resulting in a cleaner, minimalist layout relying on gestures.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-01

### Highlights
- Official launch of the application with a premium, minimalist B&W aesthetic.

### Added
- **New Visual Identity**: Implemented a professional, high-contrast B&W app icon and logo.
- **Custom Splash Screen**: Added a modern splash screen using the Android SplashScreen API with a 1-second stay-on-screen condition.
- **Destructive Action Safeguards**: Added confirmation dialogs for deleting scans and discarding unsaved work to prevent data loss.
- **Localization**: Full Italian translation (`values-it`) for all interface strings.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated GitHub Actions for automated building, signing, and releasing of APKs.

### UI/UX Improvements
